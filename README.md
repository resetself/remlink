# remlink (remote link)
A remote file operation project that can execute local host commands and directly operate files on the remote host locally through SSH connection.


### Core Functionality
* Bridge the gap between local command habits and remote file operations.
* Eliminate the need to manually upload local scripts or adapt to remote command sets.
* Ensure secure file handling (copy, edit, delete, etc.) via the existing SSH protocol.

### Key Value
Simplify remote file management workflows for developers, DevOps engineers, or anyone who frequently works with SSH-connected servers. It lets you use the commands youâ€™re familiar with locally to interact with remote files, saving time and reducing operational friction.
